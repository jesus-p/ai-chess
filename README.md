# ai-chess
This Python app lets you watch a game of chess played between two computer-controlled players. It includes a virtual chess board, follows all the rules for how each chess piece moves, and features two types of AI to control the players: one that makes random moves and another that tries to play smart using a strategy called “MinMax.”
